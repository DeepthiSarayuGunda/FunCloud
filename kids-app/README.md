# FunCloud Kids (Vite + React + Tailwind)

A playful demo frontend focused on kids animations, 3D cartoons, interactive story books, and audio stories.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd kids-app
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Notes

- This demo expects assets under `/assets/animals` and `/assets/sounds`. You can copy the existing `frontend/assets` into `kids-app/public/assets` or adjust paths.
- The 3D placeholder uses `@react-three/fiber` for lightweight scenes.
- Lottie placeholder expects `/assets/animations/placeholder.json` — replace with a kid-friendly animation.

Recommended next steps

- Replace dummy images and audio with polished assets
- Add user profile / parental controls
- Integrate a CMS or S3 for content delivery
- Add analytics and monetization flows (subscriptions)
